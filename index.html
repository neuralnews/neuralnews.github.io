    <h4>Critical Features of Neural News</h4>
    <img id="demo" src="./product_images/neural_news_demo.gif"/>
    <h5>Searching</h5>
    <p>Searching is the most important feature of the app, as the whole point is to allow users to search for the news content that they want. So, we used a couple libraries to help get the job done: React Native Search Box for the search bar and Fetch for making HTTP GET requests to our server. Users can enter a string and press search or simply click on one of the 'Trending Topics' listed on the landing page to be redirected to a screen that displays all of the information we serve.</p><br>
    <h5>Displaying Natural Language Processing Data</h5>
    <p>Once our server has resolved the user's request, our app redirects the user to a search results page, where they are presented with -- at the moment -- 3 articles and their corresponding natural language processing data. The user sees an image with the article's news source logo, the article's title, the article's brief description, and at the bottom a list of the top -- at the moment -- three entities and their respective polarities. We choose to display the polarities using images that map to discrete values to make it more easy to understand the biases present in the article for a given entity.</p><br>
    <h5>Linking to Original Article</h5>
    <p>Tapping on the logo at the top opens the mobile device's default browser and links to the article so that the user can read the article if he desires.</p>

    <h4>Testing the Server</h4>
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>After finally getting a working version of the server up and running last week, this week it was time to put it to the test. We ran a handful of tests to ensure that things were working as expected, and we realized that the 'working version of the server' was not as air-tight as we had hoped.</p>
    <h5>Challenges</h5>
    <p>One of the main problems we anticiapted when it came to testing were our API limits. As we depend on Aylien's SDK for both entity and article extraction, it is not feasible to blast the server with hundreds of automated tests, as this would near instantly drain up our API calls for the day.</p>
    <p>So, we started out slowly. First, we tested querying for easy news entities, like Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders. Testing slowly revealed subtle, nuanced errors that we were able to correct. It also revealed some nastier, more sinister fundamental flaws in our server design.</p>
    <p>For instance, we realized that asynchronous JavaScript can become a mess... even when you're doing it the right way. At first, we were iterating over a list of articles and performing asynchronous tasks (i.e. extracting the article, calling Python scripts, etc.) on them in succession. As it turns out, this can lead to overwriting of data, as the later iterations will take precedence over the earlier ones. This manifested in some of the testing JSON files we generated, which looked like the following: </p>
    <img src='./product_images/test_json_fail.png'>
    <p>As you can see, for these three articles the title, URL, and news source all have the same values, which was not what we wanted. After some grueling work, we transformed our iterative mess into a somewhat more logical process that took advantage of 'Q,' a wrapper on JavaScript's 'Promise' library. </p>
    <h5>Q Promise Library</h5>
    <p>While we could have chosen to use the native Promise library, we opted for the Q library for a few reasons. First, it was much, much easier to use. The syntax makes more logical sense, and the code becomes a lot flatter instead of extending to the right of the text editor. Also, the library gives you implicit error propagation with 'try, catch, finally.' These make the code very readable and easy to maintain, all while still giving us the asynchronous functionality our server needed.</p>

    <h3>1. Proposal and Requirements</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the need?</h4>
    <p>With the internet's huge catalog of news sources, it is all too easy to only read news that confirms your own bias. Too often, people will only listen to what Fox has to say, or on what Huffington Post has to offer. Consumers need more diverse news sources, and they need to understand the implicit biases of their sources. By allowing users to search for news and get a diverse spread of results, along with natural language analysis of the articles' content, we aim to empower the individual to be more informed of the information they extract from the media.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who is the audience?</h4>
    <p>Everyone who cares about the news -- especially those looking for a more informed news experience -- can benefit from our app.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who are the supporters and stakeholders?</h4>
    <p>Noah Weinflash, junior at Tufts University who identifies as a liberal, strongly supports this app: "We need more people to value diverse opinions in their news, and we need an easy way to see both sides of the issues."</p>
    <p>Jack Winston, senior at Boston College who identifies as a conservative, strongly supports this app: "There is a clear media bias that has existed for so long. A news portal that can objectively assess the bias of news articles can finally bring light to the serious media problem, and force people to be more critical of seemingly 'neutral' sources."</p>
    <p>Belle Newman, junior at Tufts University who identifies as independent, strongly supports this app: "With our nation divided and 'fake news' on both sides, there is an urgent need to restore trust in the media."</p>
    <p>People of all political ideologies support this app and idea. This has the capability to heal the great divide in our country, and to bring understanding and open-mindedness back into popularity.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's core functionality?</h4>
    <p>Neural News promises to deliver news articles from diverse sources upon search. Then, it will provide natural language analysis of each article based on its sentiment and content.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's secondary functionality?</h4>
    <p>If time permits, we would like to support additional sources like Facebook and Twitter posts. Also, a stretch goal would be to eventually provide an analysis of the public opinion by looking at data from the articles' comments, social media posts, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What features of the mobile device will the app use?</h4>
    <p>At this point, we do not foresee the app needing to use any special features of the mobile device aside from Internet access. However, we may use contacts or SMS in order to allow the user to connect with other users.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What are the app's limitations?</h4>
    <p>There are two main limitations of the app. First, the speed of API calls / computation of our analysis: since we depend on 3rd party APIs and libraries to perform all of the natural language analysis, it is possible that the app's load time and search feature will have some latency. Second, the accuracy of our sentiment analysis: even though the APIs we are using are very sophisticated, NLP is far from being perfect. Thus, we understand that our analysis can only be so accurate.</p>
