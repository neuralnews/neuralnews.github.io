    <h3>1. Proposal and Requirements</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the need?</h4>
    <p>With the internet's huge catalog of news sources, it is all too easy to only read news that confirms your own bias. Too often, people will only listen to what Fox has to say, or on what Huffington Post has to offer. Consumers need more diverse news sources, and they need to understand the implicit biases of their sources. By allowing users to search for news and get a diverse spread of results, along with natural language analysis of the articles' content, we aim to empower the individual to be more informed of the information they extract from the media.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who is the audience?</h4>
    <p>Everyone who cares about the news -- especially those looking for a more informed news experience -- can benefit from our app.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- What is this? -->
    <h4>Who are the supporters and stakeholders?</h4>
    <p>Noah Weinflash, junior at Tufts University who identifies as a liberal, strongly supports this app: "We need more people to value diverse opinions in their news, and we need an easy way to see both sides of the issues."</p>
    <p>Jack Winston, senior at Boston College who identifies as a conservative, strongly supports this app: "There is a clear media bias that has existed for so long. A news portal that can objectively assess the bias of news articles can finally bring light to the serious media problem, and force people to be more critical of seemingly 'neutral' sources."</p>
    <p>Belle Newman, junior at Tufts University who identifies as independent, strongly supports this app: "With our nation divided and 'fake news' on both sides, there is an urgent need to restore trust in the media."</p>
    <p>People of all political ideologies support this app and idea. This has the capability to heal the great divide in our country, and to bring understanding and open-mindedness back into popularity.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's core functionality?</h4>
    <p>Neural News promises to deliver news articles from diverse sources upon search. Then, it will provide natural language analysis of each article based on its sentiment and content.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's secondary functionality?</h4>
    <p>If time permits, we would like to support additional sources like Facebook and Twitter posts. Also, a stretch goal would be to eventually provide an analysis of the public opinion by looking at data from the articles' comments, social media posts, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What features of the mobile device will the app use?</h4>
    <p>At this point, we do not foresee the app needing to use any special features of the mobile device aside from Internet access. However, we may use contacts or SMS in order to allow the user to connect with other users.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What are the app's limitations?</h4>
    <p>There are two main limitations of the app. First, the speed of API calls / computation of our analysis: since we depend on 3rd party APIs and libraries to perform all of the natural language analysis, it is possible that the app's load time and search feature will have some latency. Second, the accuracy of our sentiment analysis: even though the APIs we are using are very sophisticated, NLP is far from being perfect. Thus, we understand that our analysis can only be so accurate. </p>
