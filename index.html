    <h3>1. Proposal and Requirements</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the need?</h4>
    <p>Consumers need more diverse news sources, and they need to understand the implicit biases of their sources. By allowing users to search for hot topics and get a spread of results along with natural language analysis of the articles' content, we aim to empower the individual to be more informed of the information they extract from the media.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Who is the audience?</h4>
    <p>With the advent of the Internet, it has never been so easy to follow the news. However, not all of the news articles available online are neutral and free of bias. Everyone who cares about the news -- especially those looking for a more informed news experience -- can benefit from our app. NeuralNews offers a way to get a more balanced spread of articles upon search as well as a brief, accessible analysis of the articles' content.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- What is this? -->
    <h4>Who are the supporters and stakeholders?</h4>
    <p>TODO</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's core functionality?</h4>
    <p>NeuralNews promises to deliver news articles from diverse sources upon search. Then, it will provide natural language analysis of each article based on its sentiment and content.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What is the app's secondary functionality?</h4>
    <p>If time permits, we would like to support additional news sources like Facebook and Twitter. Also, a stretch goal would be to eventually provide an analysis of the public opinion by looking at data from the articles' comments, social media posts, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What features of the mobile device will the app use?</h4>
    <p>At this point, we do not foresee the app needing to use any special features of the mobile device aside from Internet access. However, we may use contacts or SMS in order to allow the user to connect with other users.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What are the app's limitations?</h4>
    <p>There are two main limitations of the app. First, the speed of API calls / computation of our analysis: since we depend on 3rd party APIs and libraries to perform all of the natural language analysis, it is possible that the app's load time and search feature will have some latency. Second, the accuracy of our sentiment analysis: even though the APIs we are using are very sophisticated, NLP is far from being perfect. Thus, we understand that our analysis can only be so accurate. </p>
